# Alignment validation — 6 October 2026

## Driver services increment

- 23 unit tests, TypeScript and ESLint pass. Local HTTP checks cover verified OTP
  replay, encrypted private evidence, approval, assigned-trip commands, stale
  versions, duplicate boarding/completion, partial no-show fund hold, beneficiary
  review, simulated settlement/callback correlation, support replies and logout.
- PostgreSQL 16 test container: cofounder-schema baseline and additive migration
  applied successfully. Concurrent replay/boarding/completion and payout tests pass.
  Synthetic records are retained; this is not the Vercel production database.
- Android staging: four native emulator tests pass, including a delivered charter
  and queued KSh 1,700 settlement. No real passengers or financial movement.
  Encrypted session expiry, saved-action account isolation and tamper rejection pass.
- Full web production build passes with PostgreSQL generation, TypeScript and
  48 static-generation tasks. It uses the isolated test DB, not Vercel data.
- Instant payout HTTP completion dispatch is verified in the local simulator;
  replay still produces one transfer attempt. Queued records remain recoverable
  when dispatch is interrupted or beneficiary/configuration review defers sending.
- GitHub access to upstream is read-only; Vercel has no signed-in local session.
  Official `/api/v1/driver/status` returned 404 on 6 October 2026.

Earlier passenger alignment results follow; their driver-API limitations are
superseded by the local implementation above, not by a live deployment.

## Verified locally

- Cofounder source baseline: `687ef7a0b7e14fc97628f578dfafe15a500cd0cc`.
  Extracted source files were checked against their Git object hashes before editing.
- Original `C:\Users\user\Desktop\msafiri` was not modified. Work is in the separate
  `msafiri-web` checkout on `feat/mireli-alignment`.
- Four Vitest files / 14 tests passed: simulation boundaries, session signatures
  and claims, production authentication boundary, and Nairobi calendar handling.
- ESLint passed without disabling the React state or memoization rules.
- Final `npm run build` passed after the UI and font changes: PostgreSQL client
  generation, webpack compilation, TypeScript and all 42 static-generation tasks.
  The build used a placeholder localhost database URL and made no live connection.
- PostgreSQL Prisma schema validation and client generation passed. These checks
  do not connect to or prove compatibility with the deployed database.
- Browser test against localhost and an isolated SQLite preview: chose tomorrow,
  selected a sample stage, closed/reopened the booking form, entered synthetic
  passenger details, reserved one seat, initiated and verified a mock payment,
  and viewed the confirmed booking on My rides. Availability changed from ten to
  nine seats. No real M-Pesa request or booking was made.
- Local screenshot: `artifacts/confirmed-sample-ride.png` (ignored by Git).

## Important limits and observed follow-ups

- The preview uses synthetic SQLite data, not the claimed live Prisma Postgres
  database. PostgreSQL migration, restoration, concurrent allocation and payment
  replay tests remain required.
- Concurrent initial reads produced duplicate scheduled trip cards in the inherited
  scheduler. Its check-then-create approach needs a database uniqueness constraint
  and transactional generation before release. Existing preview records were preserved.
- A passenger gender selector emits an uncontrolled-to-controlled React warning;
  selection and booking submission worked, but this remains a UI cleanup item.
- Sample route names were adjusted in the seed to include North/South Coast so
  inherited name-based coast labels agree. The change applies on the next preview
  launch. Explicit route region fields would be more robust than name matching.
- No mobile device, production OTP, admin MFA, live payment, driver API, background
  location, Play Store submission or legal compliance validation occurred here.
- CI configuration was added but has not run on GitHub. Local runtime was Node
  26.4.0; CI targets Node 22 and must be verified independently.

See `ALIGNMENT.md` for the database reconciliation and deployment gates, and
`DRIVER-INTEGRATION.md` for how the Android app should share this backend.
