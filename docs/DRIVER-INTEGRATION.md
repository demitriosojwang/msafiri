# Connect Mireli Driver to this backend

The driver API below is now implemented locally, with native Android integration
and isolated PostgreSQL verification. It is not deployed to the official website.
Only the server uses Prisma/PostgreSQL; Android uses authenticated HTTPS.

## Implemented contract — 6 October 2026

- `/api/v1/driver/status` returns separate `phoneSignInOpen` and
  `registrationOpen` flags. Existing drivers can authenticate while new
  applications are paused; an unknown verified number cannot create a driver
  account unless intake is open. The status request itself never sends an SMS.
- POST `auth/challenges`, POST `auth/sessions`, DELETE
  `auth/session`: environment assertion, verified phone, hashed revocable sessions.
- GET/PUT `onboarding`, POST `documents/{type}`, POST `onboarding/submissions`:
  private evidence, expiry/checklist, optimistic versions and audited staff review.
- GET `trips`, POST `trips/{id}/commands`: accept/decline/arrive/board/no_show/start/
  complete, driver ownership, versioned receipts and atomic settlement creation.
  Manifests omit boarding codes and identity numbers; historical trips omit PII.
- GET `earnings`, POST `payout-destination`: KES minor units, settlement status,
  explicit beneficiary attestation and finance approval before transfers.
- GET/POST `support`: driver-owned cases, replay protection and staff replies.
- Administrative onboarding, private-document scanning, beneficiary and support
  routes have reviewer authorization, origin checks and audit records.
- Native staging passed a complete synthetic charter and account/support test.
  PostgreSQL simultaneous retries create one command effect/settlement/transfer.

Migration `20261006_driver_services` is additive against the cofounder source
baseline. Do not apply it blindly to the claimed deployed database: reconcile its
schema/history and prove backup restoration first. Production SMS/S3/scanner and
verified administrator login are not configured. No real payment was sent.

The mapping and earlier API proposal below are historical design notes. The active
contract uses `/api/v1/driver`, not the older `/api/mobile/v1` paths.

| Android concept | Cofounder source | Required interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Driver identity | `Driver.id`, status | Bind verified identity to a server-owned driver ID; reject inactive/suspended drivers |
| Assignment | `Trip.id`, `Trip.driverId` | Authorize every read/write against the assigned driver |
| Direction | `Trip.direction` | Preserve FROM_TERMINUS / TO_TERMINUS |
| Train connection | `Trip.trainId`, Train | Use server timestamps, display Africa/Nairobi |
| Route / meeting point | Route, RouteStage, booking stage snapshot | Support shared/charter, pickup/drop-off and home surcharge separately |
| Passenger party | Booking, seats, passengerName | Only paid/eligible bookings; exclude identity numbers, nationality and unrelated personal data |
| Boarding | Booking.status, checkedInAt | Verify a limited-use boarding credential; do not expose secret codes in manifests |
| Earnings | LedgerEntry, PayoutRecord | Distinguish held gross fares, driver payable, deductions and settled payout |
| Currency | Integer KSh in upstream | Android sample uses minor units: convert KSh to cents explicitly with checked integer arithmetic |

Upstream trip states are scheduled/locked/departed/completed/cancelled. Android's
preview states assigned/accepted/at_pickup/in_progress/completed are not identical.
Add an explicit driver execution state/version through a reviewed migration;
do not interpret a booking lock as driver acceptance or scheduled time as arrival.

## Proposed versioned API

- `POST /api/mobile/v1/auth/challenges` and `/auth/verify`: real verified driver
  sign-in, short-lived access tokens, rotated refresh tokens and server revocation.
- `GET /api/mobile/v1/assignments`: paginated, server-filtered driver assignments,
  server time, version and bounded next-sync cursor.
- `GET /api/mobile/v1/assignments/{id}`: minimal authorized manifest and meeting points.
- `POST /api/mobile/v1/assignments/{id}/commands`: accept, arrive, board, no-show,
  start and complete with command ID and expected version. Persist idempotency and
  state changes in one transaction. Reject stale/reassigned/cancelled trips.
- `GET /api/mobile/v1/earnings`: audited ledger projection and payout status.
- Location/device registration only after consent, permissions, retention and
  assignment ownership are implemented. Push messages signal a refresh, not authority.

No endpoint above exists merely because it is listed here. Contract tests must
prove unauthenticated, passenger, wrong-driver, suspended-driver, stale-version,
duplicate-command and lost-network cases before Android's production adapter is enabled.

The existing passenger or administrator cookie must not be embedded in Android.
Do not create a second payment ledger or copy production credentials into the APK.
